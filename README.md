# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. Breast 
cancer is the second most frequent cancer in women and men globally. In 2020, 
there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths 
globally. As of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were 
diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 5 years, making it the world's most 
prevalent cancer.These cells usually grow a tumor that can frequently be seen on 
an x-ray or considered a lump. The tumor is malignant (cancer) if the cells can 
expand into (invade) encompassing tissues or increase (metastasize) to different 
sections of the body.
Nowadays Classification and data mining methods are very effective ways to 
classify data. So with the help of Machine learning if we can classify the patient 
having which type of cancer, then it will be easy for doctors to provide timely 
treatment to patients and improve the chance of survival.
Classification of Breast Cancer
In this Machine learning project we are going to analyze and classify Breast Cancer 
(that the breast cancer belongs to which category)using a data set, as basically 
there are two categories of breast cancer that is:
• Malignant type breast cancer(M)
• Benign type breast cancer(B)
